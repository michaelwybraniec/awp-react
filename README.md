## üéØ Development Phases

### üìä Timeline Comparison: Classic vs AWP Development

| Development Approach | Estimated Timeline | Key Benefits |
|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Classic Development** | 25-33 weeks (6-8 months) | Traditional approach with manual coordination |
| **AWP Development** | 15-20 weeks (4-5 months) | AI-human collaboration, automated testing, faster iteration |

**üéØ AWP Advantages:**
- **40% faster development** through AI-human collaboration
- **Automated testing** reduces manual QA time
- **Continuous documentation** keeps everyone aligned
- **Quality gates** prevent rework and bugs
- **Structured workflow** eliminates coordination overhead

*Note: Final comparison will be measured at project completion*
