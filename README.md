## Project

Please do the project considering this description

Responsibilities:
Develop and maintain high-quality UIs: Build responsive and dynamic user interfaces using React and TypeScript, applying strong UX design principles. Translate visual designs and product requirements into clean, efficient code, ensuring the interface is pixel-perfect, accessible, and user-friendly.
Implement modern React features: Leverage the latest React capabilities, including React Server Components and Server-Side Rendering (SSR), to create fast and scalable applications.
Architect a robust component library: Create and maintain a reusable component library/design system that enforces consistency across all our applications. 
Collaborate on design & UX: Work closely with product designers and UX teams to review prototypes and iterate on designs. Provide front-end insights to ensure a healthy give-and-take between design and engineering.
Integrate with backend services: Collaborate with backend engineers to define RESTful APIs and integrate frontend components with server data and SDKs. Ensure smooth communication between the frontend and backend and contribute to API design discussions to optimize data flows and performance.
Agile development & iteration: Participate in an agile team environment, translating product requirements and user stories into fluid, user-centered features. Continuously refine the application through testing and feedback, aiming for an interface that is not just visually appealing but also intuitive and enjoyable for end users.
Skills:

Experience: 6+ years of professional experience building rich web applications with React and TypeScript.
UX & Design Sense: Solid understanding of fundamental UX principles and a keen eye for UI design details. (You should be able to create interfaces that follow usability best practices and delight users.)
React Expertise: Deep knowledge of modern React features and patterns (including hooks, context, and newer React 18+ features like Server Components and Suspense).
Component Libraries: Proven experience in creating and maintaining reusable component libraries or design systems for large-scale applications.
Collaboration: Experience working closely with backend engineers (and ideally designers) in an agile team environment. Comfortable discussing API contracts, providing feedback on designs, and iterating on features in a cross-functional setting.
Problem-Solving: Strong debugging and performance optimization skills, with a focus on responsive design and cross-browser compatibility.
Bonus Skills:
Modern Frameworks: Familiarity with frameworks and tools such as Remix or Next.js (for full stack React and advanced routing/SSR capabilities).
State Management & Data Fetching: Experience with libraries like React Query (for efficient server state management) or similar data fetching/caching solutions.
Forms & Components: Knowledge of react-hook-form for building complex forms, and UI component kits like shadcn/ui, Chakra UI, etc., to accelerate development.
Styling: Experience with Tailwind CSS or other CSS utility frameworks/CSS-in-JS libraries for rapid UI styling.
Product Design Tools: Basic familiarity with design/prototyping tools (e.g. Figma or Sketch) is a plus â€“ indicating you can comfortably discuss design details and even make minor design tweaks if needed.
